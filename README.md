# uigradients scss

This is the repo for [uigradients.com](http://uigradients.com) - A handpicked collection of beautiful colour gradients for design and code.

Hopefully this little effort will help you draw inspiration and serve as a resource for picking gradients for your own projects. 


This is a repo is a stripped down fork of [ghosh/uiGradients](https://github.com/Ghosh/uiGradients) by Indrashish Ghosh.

I felt the need to have a collection of gradient variables from [uigradients.com](http://uigradients.com),
hence tweeked the parent repo [uiGradients](https://github.com/Ghosh/uiGradients).

###Contents
1.  _gradients.scss

Consist of all the gradient variables as shown below:

2.  _gradient-mixins.scss

Contains list of all gradient mixins(over time more shall be added)

###To Use###
1. Simply paste the two files in your sass/ folder.
2. Since both are [partial files](http://sass-lang.com/guide),  just add
```    ```

```ruby
import 'gradient-mixin';
```

###Kindly Contribute Mixins for other gradient properties.
